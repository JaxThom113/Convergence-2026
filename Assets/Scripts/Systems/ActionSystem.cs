/* 
ACTION SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

Entry: Someone calls ActionSystem.Instance.Perform(gameAction)
Flow: Perform → Flow(action) → PRE phase → PERFORM phase → POST phase

PRE phase: action.PreReactions, preSubs callbacks, then PerformReactions (recursive Flow for each)
PERFORM phase: action.PerformReactions, PerformPerformer(action), then PerformReactions (recursive)
POST phase: action.PostReactions, postSubs callbacks, then PerformReactions (recursive)

Three concepts:
1. PERFORMERS - One per GameAction type. Define HOW that action executes. Registered via AttachPerformer<T>. Systems only.
2. SUBSCRIBERS - Callbacks per type. Invoked BEFORE (pre) or AFTER (post) an action runs. Registered via SubscribeReaction<T>. Observer pattern. Can AddReaction.
3. REACTIONS - Child GameActions on PreReactions, PerformReactions, PostReactions. Run via recursive Flow. Added via AddReaction (from performer/subscriber) or pre-populated on GameAction.

Key rule: Cannot call Perform from inside a performer (IsPerforming blocks it). Use AddReaction instead.

//----------------------------------------------------
// ACTION SYSTEM (main orchestrator)
// 1. Receives an action.
// 2. Executes PreReactions.
// 3. Invokes performer (core logic).
// 4. Executes PerformReactions.
// 5. Executes PostReactions.
//----------------------------------------------------

/*
Perform(action)  →  Flow(action)
                        │
                        ├─ PRE:    action.PreReactions (nested Flows)  →  preSubs callbacks
                        ├─ PERFORM: Performer(action)  →  action.PerformReactions (nested Flows)
                        └─ POST:   postSubs callbacks  →  action.PostReactions (nested Flows) 

Flow is the MAIN METHOD of the action system that orchestrates the execution of the action system. 
    a recursive method that calls itself to execute the pre reactions,  
    then when done with pre then the performer,  
    and then when done with perform then the post reactions, and then done with post reactions we call the callback set from the perform method.
    It is called by the PERFORM method, and it will execute the pre reactions, the performer, and the post reactions.
    It will also execute the pre subscribers, the performer, and the post subscribers.

//----------------------------------------------------
// PERFORMERS (systems only)
// One per GameAction type. Define HOW that action type is executed (core logic). 
// Calls the flow, which executes the pre reactions, the performer, and the post reactions from the subscribers
// Registered via AttachPerformer<T>; invoked in the middle of Flow (between pre and post).
//----------------------------------------------------

//----------------------------------------------------
// SUBSCRIBERS (preSubs / postSubs)
// Hold callbacks per action type. WHEN an action runs, we invoke them BEFORE (pre) or AFTER (post). 
// Buckets the reactions for the action type, and executes them when the action is performed, based on the timing
// Multiple callbacks per type; used for side effects (UI, logging, etc.) without owning execution.
//----------------------------------------------------

//----------------------------------------------------
// REACTIONS (on GameAction: PreReactions, PerformReactions, PostReactions)
// Child GameActions that run at each phase. Define WHAT runs and WHEN (pre / perform / post).
// Each reaction is executed via Flow; used to chain or compose actions (e.g. status effects).
